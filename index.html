            <h1>WELCOME TO THE
                BORED APE YACHT CLUB</h1>
            <p>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum
                blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only
                benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and
                perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.</p>

        <p>There are no bonding curves here. Buying a Bored Ape costs  0.08 ETH. There 
            are no price tiers; BAYC membership costs the same for  everyone.</p>
        <p class="p-1">Note: Thirty apes are being withheld from the sale.
            These will be used for giveaways, puzzle rewards—and 
            for the creators' BAYC memberships</p>

            <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write expletives.</p>
            <p>Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter.</p>
